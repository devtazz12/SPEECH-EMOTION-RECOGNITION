# SPEECCH EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM USING DEEP LEARNING (CNN)

In this SER we have used two datasets [RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio) AND [TESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess) which you can easily download form the kaggle. 

Here, you will get the complete web app in django framework with trained model with the accuracy of 81% and here you will also get the all code required for SER system and also you can train the model as per your requirements.

Feel free to comment if you are not able to understand.
